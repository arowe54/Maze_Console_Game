# Maze
This game uses ray tracing to map a maze to the Windows Powershell console in first-person view with a coordinate system.
There is a map on the top-left hand side that scrolls as the player moves. This may be configured to a full-size static map.

Navigate through the maze using: 
- **A/D** to rotate the field of view left/right 
- **W/S** to move forward/backward.


## Installation
